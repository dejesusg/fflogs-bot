# fflogs-bot
A Discord Bot written in NODE.JS, to retrieve and parse data from the FFLogs.com API

## Other features:
* Event handler, and automatic loading/checking of commands that have valid .js files
* Useful bot statistics (Uptime, User/Server Counts, Resource Usage, Latency)
* Basic, Role-limited Moderation Commands
* Music (using Node Opus, and ffmpeg) -- Optional
* Live editing of existing commands by running `{prefix}reload`


# Note: I am not supporting or updating this, it was a personal project from a few years ago... much of it (especially API-related functionality) is probably broken.

# In otherwords, this is a repo for archival purposes and I have no intention on updating it currently.
